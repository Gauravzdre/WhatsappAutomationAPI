# OAuth Setup Guide for Facebook & Instagram (Composio)

This guide will help you set up the OAuth integration using Composio's platform, so users can connect their Facebook and Instagram accounts with just one click.

## ðŸš€ Quick Setup

### 1. Get Composio API Key

1. Go to [Composio](https://composio.dev/) and create an account
2. Navigate to your dashboard and get your API key
3. The API key will be used to access Composio's OAuth capabilities

### 2. Set Environment Variables

Add this to your `.env` file:

```bash
# OAuth Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Composio Configuration (Required for OAuth)
COMPOSIO_API_KEY=your_composio_api_key_here
```

### 3. Test Composio Integration

Run the test script to see what OAuth capabilities are available:

```bash
npm run test:composio
```

This will show you:
- Available toolkits (Facebook, Instagram, etc.)
- OAuth configurations for each platform
- Required fields for OAuth connections

### 4. Test the Integration

1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Go to `/oauth-demo` to test the OAuth flow
3. Click "Connect" buttons to test Facebook and Instagram connections

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

1. **User clicks "Connect"** â†’ Composio generates OAuth URL
2. **User grants permissions** â†’ Platform redirects back with authorization code
3. **Composio handles token exchange** â†’ Gets access token automatically
4. **Account connected** â†’ User can now use platform features

## ðŸ“± Supported Platforms

Composio supports multiple platforms including:
- **Facebook** - Pages, posts, comments, insights
- **Instagram** - Posts, stories, comments, insights
- **LinkedIn** - Company pages, posts, analytics
- **Twitter/X** - Tweets, followers, analytics
- **And many more...**

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"COMPOSIO_API_KEY environment variable is required"**
   - Check that `COMPOSIO_API_KEY` is set in your `.env` file
   - Restart your development server after adding it

2. **"Toolkit not found"**
   - Run `npm run test:composio` to see available toolkits
   - Check if the platform you want is supported by Composio

3. **"No OAuth configuration found"**
   - Some platforms may not have OAuth enabled in Composio
   - Check the toolkit details for available auth schemes

### Testing

Run these test scripts to verify your setup:

```bash
# Test Composio toolkits and OAuth capabilities
npm run test:composio

# Test OAuth service logic
npm run test:oauth:simple
```

## ðŸ”’ Security Notes

- OAuth tokens are handled securely through Composio's platform
- No access tokens are stored in your application
- All communication uses HTTPS
- Composio manages token refresh and security

## ðŸ“š Next Steps

After setting up Composio OAuth:

1. Test the connection flow in your browser
2. Explore available toolkits with `npm run test:composio`
3. Integrate OAuth buttons into your main settings page
4. Use connected accounts for posting and analytics
