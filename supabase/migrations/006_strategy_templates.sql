-- Content Strategy Templates Migration
-- This adds 5 pre-built strategy templates that users can select and customize

-- First, create a strategy_templates table for reusable templates

  sample_content JSONB, -- Sample messages for each content pillar
  recommended_posting_schedule JSONB,
  target_audience_profile JSONB,
  brand_voice VARCHAR(50),
  tags TEXT[] DEFAULT ARRAY[]::TEXT[],
  is_premium BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Enable RLS on strategy templates (public read, admin write)
ALTER TABLE strategy_templates ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Policy for reading templates (all authenticated users can read)
CREATE POLICY "All users can view strategy templates" ON strategy_templates
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Policy for managing templates (only service role for now - these are managed templates)
CREATE POLICY "Service role can manage strategy templates" ON strategy_templates
  FOR ALL USING (auth.role() = 'service_role');

-- Create index for performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_strategy_templates_industry ON strategy_templates(industry);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_strategy_templates_business_type ON strategy_templates(business_type);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_strategy_templates_tags ON strategy_templates USING GIN(tags);
