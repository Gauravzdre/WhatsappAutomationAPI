## 🚀 **Next Task to Work On**

### **🎯 Current Priority: Task #1 - Messaging API Integration (PIVOT TO TELEGRAM)**

**🚀 STRATEGIC PIVOT**: Starting with **Telegram Bot API** instead of WhatsApp Business API for rapid prototyping

**Why Telegram Bot API?**
- ⚡ **Setup Time**: 30 minutes vs 1-2 weeks for WhatsApp Business verification
- 🔥 **Immediate Testing**: Real-time message testing without approval process
- 📱 **Same Core Features**: Rich messaging, webhooks, file sharing, inline keyboards
- 🏗️ **Architecture**: Build platform-agnostic system for easy WhatsApp migration later

**Updated Requirements:**
- ✅ Connect to Telegram Bot API
- ✅ Handle webhook verification (Telegram)
- ✅ Send text messages via Telegram  
- ✅ Receive incoming messages from Telegram
- ✅ Store message history (platform-agnostic database)

**Updated Implementation Steps:**
1. Create Telegram Bot API service class (30 min setup)
2. Set up Telegram webhook endpoint  
3. Implement Telegram message sending functionality
4. Add message status tracking
5. Create message storage system with platform abstraction

**Testing**: Test with real Telegram bot, verify message delivery, webhook processing, and automation features

**Migration Path**: Once platform is proven, add WhatsApp Business API as additional integration option
